        <p>
          I am Jonathan Cordero. I have been in retail and the customer service
          industry for many years. I really enjoyed working and interacting with
          people, but I felt something was lacking in my career. I wanted to do
          something different but wasn't sure what it was.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It wasn't until I came across a video about learning to code that I
          knew that is I wanted to do. Since then my curiosity for coding was
          sparked and I wanted to learn more. I discovered a website that
          teaches you the basics of writing code. After that I decided to self
          study for a while before finding a school that accelarates the
          learning process. That school was Fullstack Academy which I graduated
          from in 2020.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am all in and ready for a career change. I know working in the
          software engineering field will help me grow as a person. My goal is
          to become a senior software engineer.
