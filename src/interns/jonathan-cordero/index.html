        <p>
          I am Jonathan Cordero. I have been in retail and the customer service
          industry for many years. I really enjoyed working with people and
          interacting with them, but I felt something was lacking in my career.
          I wanted to do something different but wasn't sure what it was.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wasn't until I came across a video about learning to code that I
          knew what I wanted to do. Since then my curiosity became larger and I
          wanted to learn more. I found a website that teaches you the basics
          while you write out the code. Since then I've decided to self study
          for a while before finding a school that accelarates the learning
          process.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At this point I knew I had to go all in for a career change and do
          something that helps me grow. My goal is to become a software engineer
